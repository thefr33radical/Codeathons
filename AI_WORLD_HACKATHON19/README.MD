# FAIM: the Fractal Artificial Intelligence Model

We will demonstrate the power of using a "Fractal Approach" to multiple different data sets. We will showcase that the strength of this particular model is in being able to quickly and efficiently compute large data sets that have space & time components. We will also show how the same model can be applied to multiple different data sets with little to no adjustments.
