### Summary
IOBoT aims to solve the challenges involved in Investor Onboarding process.  The present procedure in place is languid - Resulting in poor user experience, Inefficient - Expensive to maintain, Obscure - Hard to audit and ensure compliance and impacts all the stakeholders involved in the process ie  Investors,  Broker Firms and Regulators.
The expectations from IOBoT is to reduce the cost of verification, ensure data is tamper proof which guarantees data integrity, enhance transparency, better ease of use for consumers and lastly creates stickiness.
