### Summary

Inspiration:
The present challenge in Finance and Investment industry is a lack of cutting edge models that can also be explainable.

What it does:
The core of Ploutus is comprised of Forecasting algorithms that can do 3/7/10 day rolling forecasts.
We use Hybrid Models for Forecasting comprising of SARIMA-SVR, CNN-LSTM along with standalone models such as ARIMA, LSTM, ExpSmoothing. Here we can see in the long run Hybrid models reduce RMSE.
Ploutus scrapes data of the company we are looking to invest in. Shows the latest news about the company. Shows the Wiki for the company. Shows the options available for rolling or all at once forecast.
The dashboard contains easier to understand stock data and it acts as a financial investment adviser. The dashboard forecasts given companies stocks and gives you advises on Investing.the dashboard is interactive and features additional features stock based news, recommendations** & risk factor**.
