## SOLUTION FOR GENERATING MISSING VALUES

### Machine Learning based approaches

#### Supervised Discrete value generation
* If the missingvalue to be predicted is categorical based on the data we have built models with multiple input and multi output classifier models : Support vector classifier, Random Forest classifier, Custom Neural net Classifier.

#### Supervised Continious value generation
 * If the missingvalue to be predicted is continious we have built models withi multiple input and multi output regression models  Support vector Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Custom Neural net Regressor with last layer dimension equal to number of mising values to predict.
 
 * the neural net architecture has 7 hidden layers.
 #### Unsupervised based data generation
 * Mising data is also generated by using heirachial clustering based on coSine similarity metric
 *  Mising data is also generated by using Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations.
 
### Statistical approaches
* MEAN, MEDIAN, MOST FREQUENT imputing
* Synthetic minority over-sampling technique
* Adaptive Synthetic Sampling Approach
